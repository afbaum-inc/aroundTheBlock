        <h2>About Mike Morris</h2>
        <h3>Employing Broker / Owner / President</h3>
        <p>While in the Air Force I moved all over the country.  I know what it takes to relocate,
        and I will do everything I can to make you feel at home in my adopted community of Colorado
        Springs.  I also work with investors ensuring maximum returns on investments.  I graduated from
        Texas A&M with a Bachelor's degree and obtained my MBA while in the Air Force.
        I have been a Teacher, Airman (enlisted and officer), a First Responder and a
        Private Contractor.  I finally decided to make my real estate hobby into my life's work.  I am
        a proud husband
        of a wonderful woman and I have three gifted children. <br> My goal in life is to help families
        and individuals achieve their dreams.  I will get you the best deal.  I proudly serve fellow
        Veterans, First Responders, and Teachers.</p>

        <h2>About Mike Dunlap</h2>
        <h3>Agent</h3>
        <p>My wife and I moved to Colorado a little over three years ago after deciding to sell
        our home in Illinois.  We wanted to experience all that Colorado has to offer.  We are
        enjoying the weather, the mountains and all  of the diversity.  <br>I have always been someone
        who likes to stay busy, and decided that it was a perfect time to try a different career
        path.  After getting my Bachelor's Degree in Public Relations, I decided to become a tradesman.
        It was a great way to experience different aspects of the housing industry.  Real estate is the avenue
        that aloows me to use my knowledge and combine it with the experienve that I have had out in the field.  <br>
        Home improvement has been a passion of mine.  I engoy the outdoor, hiking, golfing, and site seeing.
        Family time is very important to me, making sure to keep balance in my life.  The knowledge that I have
        in home renovations lets me help my clients make the right choices for their needs.  I enjoy working with people
        and seeing them accompish their dreams.</p>
