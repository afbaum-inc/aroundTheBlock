      <div class="coloradoSpringsHistory">
        <h3>History of Colorado Springs</h3>
        <p>Colorado Springs was founded on July 31, 1871 by General William
          Palmer, with the intention of creating a high-quality resort
          community, and was soon nicknamed “Little London” because of the many
          English tourists who came. Nearby Pikes Peak and the Garden of the
          Gods made the city’s location a natural choice.<br>
          Within two years his flagship resort the Antlers Hotel opened,
          welcoming U.S. and international travelers as well as health-savvy
          individuals seeking the high altitude and dry climate, and Palmer’s
          visions of a thriving, quality resort town were coming true. Soon
          after, he founded the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad, a critical
          regional railroad. He maintained his presence in the city’s early
          days by making many grants or sales of land to civic institutions.
          Palmer and his wife saw Colorado Springs develop into one of the most
          popular travel destinations in the late 1800s United States.<br>The
          town of Palmer Lake and a geographic feature called the Palmer Divide
          (and other more minor features) are named after him, and a bronze
          sculpture of Palmer on a horse is prominently displayed downtown in
          front of Palmer High School, at the center of the intersection of
          Nevada Avenue and Platte Avenue.</p>
